    An OS Manager is responsible for communication the service the different actions to take (i.e. adding a windows machine to a domain)
    The Service (i.e. virtual machine) communicates with the OSManager via a published web method, that must include the unique ID.
    In order to make easier to agents identify themselfs, the Unique ID can be a list with various Ids (i.e. the macs of the virtual machine). 
    Server will iterate thought them and look for an identifier associated with the service. This list is a comma separated values (i.e. AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF,00:11:22:...)

        This will be invoked prior to passsing username/password to Transport.
        
        This method allows us to "change" username and/or password "on the fly".
        One example of use of this is an OS Manager that creates a random password for an user. 
        In that case, this method, if the username passed in is the same as the os manager changes the password for, return the changed password.
        
        MUST Return:
            An array with 2 elements, [newUserName, newPassword].
            Default method simplt does nothing with in parameters, just returns it. (So, if your os manager does not need this,
            simply do not implement it)
