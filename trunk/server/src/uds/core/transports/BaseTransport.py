    An OS Manager is responsible for communication the service the different actions to take (i.e. adding a windows machine to a domain)
    The Service (i.e. virtual machine) communicates with the OSManager via a published web method, that must include the unique ID.
    In order to make easier to agents identify themselfs, the Unique ID can be a list with various Ids (i.e. the macs of the virtual machine). 
    Server will iterate thought them and look for an identifier associated with the service. This list is a comma separated values (i.e. AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF,00:11:22:...)

        This method must provide information about connection. 
        We don't have to implement it, but if we wont to allow some types of connections

        kind of terminals/application will not work

        The expected result from this method is a dictionary, containing at least:
            'protocol': protocol to use, (there are a few standard defined in 'protocols.py', if yours does not fit those, use your own name
            'username': username (transformed if needed to) used to login to service
            'password': password (transformed if needed to) used to login to service
            'domain': domain (extracted from username or wherever) that will be used. (Not necesarily an AD domain)
            
        :note: The provided service can be an user service or an deployed service (parent of user services).
               I have implemented processUserPassword in both so in most cases we do not need if the service is
               DeployedService or UserService. In case of processUserPassword for an DeployedService, no transformation
               is done, because there is no relation at that level between user and service.
