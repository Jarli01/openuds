    Manages registered groups for an specific authenticator.
    
    Most authenticators (except internal database one, that is an special case)
    has their database of users and passwords outside UDS. Think, for example,
    about LDAP. It has its own database of users and groups, and has its own
    correspondence of which user belongs to which group.
    
    UDS Only knows a subset of this groups, those that the administrator has
    registered inside UDS.
    
    To manage the equivalence between groups from the authenticator and UDS groups,
    we provide a list of "known groups" by uds. The authenticator then makes the 
    correspondence, marking the groups (UDS groups) that the user belongs to as
    valid.
    
    Managed groups names are compared using case insensitive comparison.
